This repository contains scripts and instructions for managing Azure subscriptions using PowerShell. It includes commands to check the current subscription, list all available subscriptions, and switch between them.

## Repository Overview

### Folder Structure

- **/scripts**: Contains PowerShell scripts for Azure subscription management.
- **README.md**: Instructions on how to use the repository and its contents.

### Repository Features

- **Subscription Check**: Check the current subscription you're working in.
- **List Subscriptions**: List all Azure subscriptions you have access to.
- **Switch Subscriptions**: Easily switch between different Azure subscriptions.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure PowerShell Module**: Ensure you have the `Az` module installed. If not, install it using:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Force
   ```

- **Azure Account Access**: You must have access to one or more Azure subscriptions.

## Commands

### 1. **Login to Azure Account**

To manage Azure subscriptions, first, log in to your Azure account:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

This will open a browser window where you can authenticate with your Azure credentials.

### 2. **Check the Current Subscription**

To see which Azure subscription is currently active:

```powershell
Get-AzContext
```

Example output:
```
Name                                     Account            SubscriptionName       Environment         TenantId
----                                     -------            ----------------       -----------         --------
Visual Studio Enterprise (your current)  user@domain.com    Visual Studio Ent...    AzureCloud          xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

This shows the current subscription name, account, and other details.

### 3. **List All Subscriptions**

To list all subscriptions you have access to:

```powershell
Get-AzSubscription
```

This command will list all subscriptions, including their names, IDs, and tenant IDs.

### 4. **Switch Between Subscriptions**

If you have multiple subscriptions and want to switch to another:

```powershell
Set-AzContext -Subscription "SubscriptionName or SubscriptionId"
```

Replace `"SubscriptionName or SubscriptionId"` with the name or ID of the subscription you want to switch to. After switching, all subsequent commands will run within the selected subscription.
